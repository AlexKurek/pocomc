``pocoMC`` is a Python implementation of `Preconditioned Monte Carlo (PMC)`.
Using ``pocoMC`` one can perform Bayesian inference, including model comparison, 
for challenging scientific problems. ``pocoMC``'s sophisticated `normalizing flow
preconditioning` procedures enable efficient sampling from highly correlated posterior
distributions. ``pocoMC`` is designed to excel in demanding parameter estimation
problems that include multimodal and highly non--Gaussian target distributions.
