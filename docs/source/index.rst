**pocoMC** is a Python implementation of Preconditioned Monte Carlo (PMC). Using
`pocoMC` one can perform Bayesian inference, including model comparison, for
challenging scientific problems. `pocoMC`'s sophisticated normalizing flow
preconditioning procedures enables sampling from highly correlated posterior
distributions. `pocoMC` is designed to excel in demanding parameter estimation
problems that include multimodal and highly non--Gaussian target distributions.
